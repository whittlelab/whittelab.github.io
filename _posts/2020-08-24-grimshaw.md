Loss in axial compressor bleed systems is quantified and the loss mechanisms
are identified to determine how efficiency can be improved. For a given bleed
air pressure requirement, reducing bleed system loss allows air to be bled from
further upstream in the compressor, with benefits for the thermodynamic cycle.
A definition of isentropic efficiency, which includes bleed flow is used to
account for this. Two cases with similar bleed systems are studied: a
low-speed, single-stage research compressor, and a large industrial gas turbine
high-pressure compressor. A new method for characterizing bleed system loss is
introduced, using research compressor test results as a demonstration case. A
loss coefficient is defined for a control volume including only flow passing
through the bleed system. The coefficient takes a measured value of 95% bleed
system inlet dynamic head and is shown to be a weak function of compressor
operating point and bleed rate, varying by Â±2.2% over all tested conditions.
This loss coefficient is the correct nondimensional metric for quantifying and
comparing bleed system performance. Computations of the research compressor and
industrial gas turbine compressor identify the loss mechanisms in the bleed
system flow. In both cases, approximately two-thirds of total loss is due to
shearing of a high-velocity jet at the rear face of the bleed slot, one-quarter
is due to mixing in the plenum chamber, and the remainder occurs in the
off-take duct. Therefore, the main objective of a designer should be to diffuse
the flow within the bleed slot. A redesigned bleed slot geometry is presented
that achieves this objective and reduces the loss coefficient by 31%.
