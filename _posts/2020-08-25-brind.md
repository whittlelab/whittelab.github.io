The mechanisms of blade row interaction affecting rotor film cooling are
identified in order to make recommendations for the design of film cooling in
the real, unsteady turbine environment. Present design practice makes the
simplifying assumption of steady boundary conditions, despite intrinsic
unsteadiness due to blade row interaction; we argue that if film cooling
responds non-linearly to unsteadiness, the time-averaged performance will then
be in error. Non-linear behaviour is confirmed using experimental measurements
of flat-plate cylindrical film cooling holes, main-stream unsteadiness causing
a reduction in film effectiveness of up to 31% at constant time-averaged
boundary condition. Unsteady computations are used to identify the blade row
interaction mechanisms in a high-pressure turbine rotor: a 'negative jet'
associated with the upstream vane wake, and frozen and propagating vane
potential field interactions. A quasi-steady model is used to predict unsteady
excursions in momentum flux ratio of rotor cooling holes, with fluctuations of
at least 30% observed for all hole locations. Computations with modified
upstream vanes are used to vary the relative strength of wake and potential
field interactions. In general, both mechanisms contribute to rotor film
cooling unsteadiness.  It is recommended that the designer should choose a
cooling configuration which behaves linearly over the expected unsteady
excursions in momentum flux ratio as predicted by a quasi-steady hole model.
