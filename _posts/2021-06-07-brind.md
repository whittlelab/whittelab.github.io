We quantify the sensitivity of turbine acoustic impedance to aerodynamic design
parameters. Impedance boundary conditions are an influential yet uncertain
parameter in predicting thermoacoustic stability of gas turbine combustors. We
extend the semi-actuator disk model to cambered blades, using non-linear
time-domain computations of turbine vane and stage cascades with acoustic
forcing for validation data. Discretising cambered aerofoils into multiple
disks improves reflection coefficient predictions, reducing error by up to an
order of magnitude compared to a flat plate. A parametric study of turbine
stage designs using the analytical model shows acoustic impedance is a weak
function of degree of reaction and polytropic efficiency. The design parameter
with the strongest influence is flow coefficient, followed by axial velocity
ratio and Mach number. We provide the combustion engineer with improved tools
to predict impedance boundary conditions, and suggest thermoacoustic stability
is most likely to be compromised by change in turbine flow coefficient.
